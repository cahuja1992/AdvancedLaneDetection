**Advanced Lane Finding Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

###Writeup / README

###Camera Calibration
I started with computing the camera matrix and thus the distrotion coefficients. For this, the object points on the chessboard were generated first using `cv2.findChessboardCorners`. Then the camera matrix and the distrotion coefficients were extracted using `cv2.calibrateCamera`. Then, `cv.undistrot` is used the correct the image by computed camera matrix and distrotion coefficients.
Following is the output of processed images:

###Pipeline (single images)
#### 1. Corrected Distrotion-corrected image
The above computed distrition coefficients and camera matrix is used to undistrot the image.
`image = cv2.undistort(img, mtx, dist, None, mtx)` where, mtx is camera matrix and dist is distrotion coefficients.

#### 2. Color transforms, gradients or other methods to create a thresholded binary image

#### 3. Perspective transform

#### 4. Identify lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial

#### 5. Calculate the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to the center.

###Discussion

There is some noise that is interfering with detection of lane lines,which at some instances draw higher curvature that can be seen in test6.jpg image and a lot of noise in test1.jpg.
To address the above issues the following things can be done :
	* We can increase the x gradient minimum threshold to filter out noise.
	* We can consider the sequence of images in order to undrstand the radius correctly, i.e the next frame will have similar curvature of previous frame.
